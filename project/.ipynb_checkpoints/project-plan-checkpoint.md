# Project Plan

## Summary

This project involves developing a predictive model to forecast the number of bicycles passing through a specific location on a given day, based on historical data. The dataset includes variables such as date, time, weather, temperature, and number of bicycles. The steps need to be taken for succesfful implementation of this project are data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and deployment. The main purpose is to create an accurate model that can be used to predict future bike usage patterns, which can be useful for city planners, bike rental services, and transportation authorities.

## Rationale

The analysis has several potential impacts that can help address some of the challenges related to cycling and urban transportation, such as:
1. Improved Infrastructure Planning: The predictive model can help city planners and transportation authorities anticipate future demand for cycling infrastructure and plan accordingly. For example, if the model predicts a surge in bicycle usage in a particular area during a certain time of day or under specific weather conditions, planners can consider installing new bike lanes or increasing the capacity of existing ones.
2. Better Resource Allocation: Bike rental services and transportation authorities can use the model's predictions to allocate resources more efficiently.
3. Sustainable Transportation Promotion: The analysis can help promote cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation, by providing insights into usage patterns and highlighting the benefits of cycling. 

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Bicycle counts in Konstanz
* Metadata URL: https://mobilithek.info/offers/-7161835583190029268
* Data URL: https://offenedaten-konstanz.de/sites/default/files/Zaehlstelle_Herose_2019_stuendlich_Wetter.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The data set contains the measurement results of the bicycle counts in the Constance urban area. With this data, it can be determined exactly when and how many cyclists were on the road at that specific location. The measurement results are recorded in 60-minute intervals. The counting stations serve as an important data basis for the city's cycling policy. Currently, the city of Constance operates one permanent counting station in the city area. The bicycle counting station is located at the end of the bicycle bridge near Herosépark.

The variables of the dataset are:
1. Date
2. Time
3. Total number of Bicycles
4. Weather
5. Temperature (°C) and Temperature felt (°C)
6. Rain (mm)

### Datasource2: Open bicycle's data (several various cities and datatypes)
* Metadata URL: https://www.bicycle-data.de/bicycles-data/
* Data URL (Just one example: Erlangen): https://bicycle.vlba.uni-oldenburg.de/csv?region=Erlangen&table=zaehl&startDate=2018-01-01&endDate=2022-03-14&stations=NürnbergerStr&stations=Wöhrmühlesteg&columns=bothDirections&columns=city&columns=classification
* Data Type: CSV

In this website, you can generate dataset link and download it yourself by giving details such as:
1. Datatype
2. Region
3. Start and End dates
4. Locations
5. Attributes
6. Data format

The dataset contains the variables you stated as details before generating.
